These are the scripts used in my final year project. All were developed by myself apart from the halo_energy_plot.py script. This is a modified version of a
script by Will Roper and so is only partly my work. Another script named mbl_comp.py is also written based off a function by Will Roper. A
second version named main_branch_len.py was developed by me and was developed for the same purpose and worked however, the use of Will's script was the
best script to use in the context of this project and so it was the main use for producing the results for the main branch length plot.
